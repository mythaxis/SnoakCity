# Cantique

Cantique is a direct reference to the "Cantique des Cantiques" ("The song of the Songs" or "Song of Salomon"), a poem expressing the woman's desire.

The Cantique typeface marks also the marriage between human calligraphy and geometric construction shapes with a modular approach. Circle, triangle and square are the key shapes; uppercase letters are sometimes built on two different levels, as is the case for the B, G, P, R, S and T.

Its main inspiration were some hand-carved titles used in post-romantic French bookplates, both for their ornamental qualities and for their kind of medieval mood. It provides language support for most latin-based European languages and for Vietnamese.

Cantique intends to spread sensuality, spirit and love.
